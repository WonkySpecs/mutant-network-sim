3rd year project program for William Taylor, Durham University

A simulation program designed to estimate the fixation probabilities of a mutant population on arbitrary graph structures

Basic usage
===========
After selecting a graphclass from the list box, enter the required parameters for the graph and the simulation.
Output modes include:
1. Console - Displays output as text in the console
2. Verbose - Adds more detailed output to the console output, most of which is unneccessary most of the time
3. File output - Writes the result of the experiment to a file in the /results/graph_class folder.
4. Graph output - Dsiplays a histogram of time to fixation for the simulation

Managing graph classes
=======================
Cusotm graph classes are stored in the /graph_classes directory in a human readable format. Whilst it is advised not to change
any of the formatting of these files, changing the contents is currently the only way to modify a graph class.
